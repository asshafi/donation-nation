            <p>Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative
                costs,<br>
                preventing the full amount from reaching the
                people or causes they really want to help.</p>

            <h1>Shelter for a family</h1>
            <p>Sharing the experience of donating to charity with your children shows them from a young age that they
                can make positive changes in the world.</p>

            <img src="img/food.png" alt="">
            <h1>Food for a family</h1>
            <p>Children naturally love to help others, so nurturing their innate generosity is likely to mean that they
                grow up with a greater appreciation of what they have, and will carry on supporting charity in years to
                come.</p>

            <h1>Education for a family</h1>
            <p>Starting a tradition of donating to charity with your children is easy - try creating a family donation
                box that everyone can add to and nominate a family charity each year, involving the children in choosing
                which causes to support.</p>
